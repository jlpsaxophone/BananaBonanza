# BananaBonanza
CIS 580 game project. Collect bananas and return them to the barrel. Avoid bombs and play for the highest score!

Move using the arrow keys (you can only move along the grass, not in the sky). You can hold up to 5 bananas. Touching 
the barrel will turn all the bananas you are holding. The number of bananas you are holding and your score are displayed
at the top of the screen. When you hit a bomb, it is game over!
